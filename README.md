   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd social_app_1
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r enhanced_system/requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up environment variables in `.env`:
   ```
   DB_HOST=localhost

## Tool Selection Justification

### Frontend: Streamlit

**Suitability**: Streamlit provides a rapid development environment for data-centric applications, making it ideal for creating interactive forms, displaying application status, and integrating AI chat interfaces.

**Scalability**: While Streamlit has some scalability limitations for very high-traffic applications, it supports session state management and can be containerized for horizontal scaling in cloud environments.

**Maintainability**: Streamlit's Python-based approach allows for easy maintenance by data scientists and engineers without requiring frontend expertise. The code is concise and follows a clear pattern.

**Performance**: For moderate user loads, Streamlit provides adequate performance. For a social security application system with predictable user patterns, this is sufficient.

**Security**: Streamlit provides built-in CSRF protection and can be deployed behind authentication layers. Additional security measures like input validation are implemented in our solution.

### Backend API: FastAPI

**Suitability**: FastAPI is designed for building high-performance APIs with Python, offering automatic validation, documentation, and async support - perfect for our system's needs.

**Scalability**: FastAPI's asynchronous capabilities allow it to handle high concurrency efficiently. It can be deployed in containerized environments for horizontal scaling.

**Maintainability**: FastAPI's automatic documentation, type hints, and dependency injection make the codebase highly maintainable and self-documenting.

**Performance**: FastAPI is one of the fastest Python frameworks available, comparable to Node.js and Go for many workloads, making it suitable for our backend processing.

**Security**: FastAPI includes built-in security features like OAuth2 with JWT tokens, which we utilize for secure API access. Its automatic validation helps prevent common injection attacks.

### Database: PostgreSQL

**Suitability**: PostgreSQL offers robust relational database capabilities with excellent support for JSON data, making it ideal for storing structured application data alongside document metadata.

**Scalability**: PostgreSQL supports horizontal scaling through solutions like Citus, and vertical scaling with excellent performance on high-specification hardware.

**Maintainability**: As a mature, open-source database, PostgreSQL has extensive documentation, tooling, and community support.

**Performance**: PostgreSQL provides excellent performance for read/write operations and supports advanced indexing strategies used in our implementation.

**Security**: PostgreSQL offers robust security features including role-based access control, row-level security, and encryption, which we implement in our solution.

### LLM Integration: Ollama

**Suitability**: Ollama provides a straightforward way to run large language models locally, ideal for providing AI assistance without external API dependencies.

**Scalability**: While running locally limits scalability, Ollama can be containerized and deployed in a distributed environment for higher throughput.

**Maintainability**: Ollama's simple API and configuration make it easy to maintain and update models.

**Performance**: Using the Mistral model provides a good balance between response quality and performance on standard hardware.

**Security**: By running locally, Ollama eliminates concerns about sending sensitive application data to external APIs. Our implementation includes additional validation of AI outputs.

### Multi-Agent Framework: Custom Implementation

**Suitability**: A custom agent framework allows precise control over the application workflow and business logic specific to social security applications.

**Scalability**: Our agent implementation is designed with asynchronous processing capabilities, allowing for horizontal scaling of individual agent components.

**Maintainability**: The agent system is modularized with clear interfaces between components, making it easy to update individual agents without affecting others.

**Performance**: By separating concerns into specialized agents, the system can process different aspects of applications in parallel, improving overall throughput.

**Security**: The agent framework implements principle of least privilege, with each agent having access only to the data it needs to perform its function.
